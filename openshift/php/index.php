  This is a program designed to show off how rediculously easy simple SSLStrip-based attacks are to perform against many popular websites (including many banks!).<br>
  Before you can run it, you need libpcap, sslstrip (get these from your local package manager) and the Jpcap package for your OS (see <a href="http://netresearch.ics.uci.edu/kfujii/Jpcap/doc/download.html">their download page</a>).<br>
  Grab <a href=nuclearsheep.jar>the jar</a> and run (as root) with java -jar nuclearsheep.jar<br>
  You can find a copy of the code at <a href="https://github.com/TheBlueMatt/nuclearsheep">GitHub</a>.<br>
